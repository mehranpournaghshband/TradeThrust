---

## ✅ **NEW FEATURES IMPLEMENTED**

### 1. **🎯 Buy Point Calculation with Buffer**
```python
# Derives from pivot point of VCP or breakout level
buy_point = pivot_point * 1.01  # 1% buffer above breakout point
```

**Features:**
- Calculates precise buy point from base pivot analysis
- Adds 1% buffer above pivot for safe entry
- Handles extended stocks (already above buy point)
- Status indicators: READY TO BUY, EXTENDED, WAIT FOR SETUP

### 2. **🎯 Formal Sell Points (Targets)**
```python
sell_target_1 = buy_point * 1.20  # +20%
sell_target_2 = buy_point * 1.35  # +35%
sell_target_3 = buy_point * 1.50  # +50%
```

**Features:**
- Three formal profit targets based on buy point
- Risk/reward ratio calculations
- Integrated into risk management system
- Displayed prominently in both summary and detailed modes

### 3. **📊 Previous Breakout Detection**
```python
# Scans last 30-60 days for breakout patterns
# Detects volume + price surge from past 4-8 weeks
```

**Features:**
- Identifies prior breakouts with volume confirmation
- Tracks breakout date, price, and strength
- Volume ratio analysis (requires 1.5x average volume)
- Flags stocks that already broke out vs. fresh setups

### 4. **⚠️ Breakout Failure Detection**
```python
# Tracks if price retraced below pivot + failed to reclaim
failure_threshold = breakout_price * 0.93  # 7% below breakout
```

**Features:**
- Monitors failed breakouts with 7% retracement threshold
- Calculates retracement percentage
- Provides "FAILED BREAKOUT" warnings
- Updates recommendations to avoid failed setups

### 5. **🔧 Modularized Functions**
```python
def check_price_vs_smas(price, sma_50, sma_150, sma_200):
    return price > sma_50 and price > sma_150 and price > sma_200

def check_sma_relationships(sma_50, sma_150, sma_200):
    return sma_50 > sma_150 > sma_200
```

**Functions Added:**
- `check_price_vs_smas()` - Price vs moving average checks
- `check_sma_relationships()` - SMA alignment verification
