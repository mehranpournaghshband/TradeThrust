## 🎓 Minervini Methodology Explained

TradeThrust implements the complete **SEPA (Specific Entry Point Analysis)** system:

### Phase 1: Trend Template (8 Criteria)
1. ✅ **Price above 50, 150, 200-day SMAs** - Stock in uptrend
2. ✅ **150-day SMA > 200-day SMA** - Long-term uptrend
3. ✅ **50-day SMA > 150 & 200-day SMAs** - Momentum acceleration
4. ✅ **Price above 50-day SMA** - Short-term strength
5. ✅ **200-day SMA trending up** - Market structure healthy
6. ✅ **Price ≥30% above 52-week low** - Significant recovery
7. ✅ **Price ≤25% from 52-week high** - Near breakout zone
8. ✅ **Relative Strength ≥70** - Outperforming market

### Phase 2: VCP Base Formation
- 📉 **Contractions get smaller** - Tightening pattern
- 📊 **Volume declines during pullbacks** - Selling exhaustion
- 🎯 **Final contraction is tight** - Coiled spring effect

### Phase 3: Entry Signal
- 📈 **Volume breakout** - 40%+ above average
- 🚀 **Price breaks resistance** - Clear entry point
- 🎯 **Tight action before breakout** - Clean structure
